1. Abstract

We present a novel cosmological framework in which gravitational interactions extend across temporally adjacent hypersurfaces—termed “now slices”—within a four-dimensional block universe. In this model, each temporal layer exhibits semi-autonomous thermodynamic behavior but remains subtly influenced by curvature and entropy gradients from neighboring slices. We define temporal shear as a geometric and thermodynamic strain generated by differential entropy-curvature alignment between slices, resulting in measurable effects such as shear heat—a proposed dissipative energy term manifesting in cosmic voids and low-frequency anomalies.

Expanding this framework, we introduce a fractal formulation of time: each now slice exhibits recursive substructure, providing a natural scaffold for modeling quantum indeterminacy, entropy bifurcation, and nonlocal correlations as emergent from inter-slice fractal resonance. A proposed entropy-curvature field equation governs the dynamics of this interaction, replacing the need for exotic fields such as dark energy with geometrically grounded mechanisms rooted in Einsteinian and thermodynamic principles.

This theory predicts a range of novel phenomena, including cosmic acceleration without vacuum energy, redshift reinterpretation, low-multipole distortions in the CMB, and asymmetric gravitational lensing. We argue that a fractal-temporal interpretation of spacetime offers a more empirically grounded and ontologically coherent alternative to prevailing cosmological models, reconciling general relativity with quantum behavior through layered entropy dynamics and nonlocal gravitational feedback.

2. Introduction

Modern cosmology faces a growing conceptual tension: while observations are increasingly precise, the theoretical frameworks built to interpret them rely heavily on constructs—such as dark energy, inflationary fields, and multiverses—that remain untestable or undefined. The Lambda-CDM model, though widely accepted, accounts for nearly 95% of the universe through entities that have not been directly observed, raising epistemological questions about the boundary between science and metaphysics.

Amidst this uncertainty, alternative cosmological frameworks have gained renewed interest. One such foundation is the block universe, or eternalism, which reinterprets spacetime as a four-dimensional manifold in which all events—past, present, and future—coexist. Originating from Minkowski’s geometric interpretation of spacetime and implicitly endorsed by Einstein, the block universe removes the privileged status of the “now” and treats time not as a flowing entity but as a dimensional coordinate, equivalent to space.

While philosophically compelling, the block universe has rarely been explored as a dynamic model of physical processes. This paper proposes such a treatment: rather than viewing spacetime as static and inert, we present a stratified block universe in which each temporal slice—or “now surface”—functions as a semi-autonomous thermodynamic system, embedded within and influenced by the global manifold. These slices are subject to inter-slice gravitational coupling, wherein curvature and entropy differentials propagate transversely across time, creating measurable geometric and thermodynamic effects.

At the core of this model is the concept of temporal shear—a form of differential strain arising from entropy-curvature mismatches between neighboring slices. Analogous to frame-dragging in rotating spacetime, temporal shear introduces a directional tension across the time axis, capable of generating dissipative energy or “shear heat” in the presence of sharp entropic gradients. These effects may account for several known anomalies, including unexplained heating in cosmic voids, asymmetries in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and apparent cosmic acceleration without invoking exotic energy fields.

To deepen this framework, we introduce the hypothesis that time itself may possess a fractal geometry. By modeling each now slice as a recursively structured, self-similar submanifold, we align our approach with the scale-relativity theory proposed by Nottale and others. This fractal interpretation offers a powerful explanatory bridge between macroscopic gravitational dynamics and microscopic quantum phenomena, allowing for wavefunction decoherence, indeterminacy, and nonlocality to be reframed as emergent behaviors of entropy resonance and recursive geometric coupling.

This paper builds a complete theoretical scaffold around this unified vision. In what follows, we define the structure and properties of temporal slices, formulate the governing field equations for entropy-curvature interaction, explore fractal emergence at quantum scales, and derive observational predictions consistent with current data. By grounding our model in established thermodynamic and relativistic principles—without introducing unverified constructs—we aim to provide a parsimonious yet robust reinterpretation of cosmic dynamics within a block universe of layered, resonant time.

3. Foundations of the Block Universe and Thermodynamic Foliation

3.1 The Ontology of the Block Universe

The block universe, or eternalist model, posits that spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold in which all events—past, present, and future—are equally real and coexistent. This view contrasts with presentism and dynamic time models, which privilege the “now” as uniquely real. The block universe arises naturally from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity, wherein no coordinate frame—temporal or spatial—is ontologically preferred.

This geometric interpretation was formalized by Hermann Minkowski in 1908 and later reinforced by Einstein, who declared the separation between past, present, and future to be “a stubbornly persistent illusion.” Within this framework, time is not something that flows but rather a dimension through which observers trace worldlines. Events do not unfold in sequence but exist as a static, structured continuum.

3.2 Foliation and Hypersurfaces of ‘Now’

To explore physical dynamics within this static manifold, we introduce a foliation of spacetime into a sequence of three-dimensional, spacelike hypersurfaces \Sigma_n, each representing a local “now slice” embedded within the global manifold \mathcal{M}. These hypersurfaces are parameterized by a global or local time function t: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, and characterized by an intrinsic metric h_{ij} and extrinsic curvature tensor K_{ij}.

This decomposition allows us to track geometric and thermodynamic properties slice-by-slice. Unlike traditional ADM decompositions, we endow each slice with local thermodynamic autonomy, treating it as a semi-closed system with its own entropy field, boundary conditions, and curvature profile.

3.3 Thermodynamic Foliation and Entropic Autonomy

Each now slice is thermodynamically distinct, possessing a unique entropy distribution S^{(n)}(x^i) and capable of interacting with its temporal neighbors through entropy exchange and curvature feedback. Entropy flow is not constrained to within-slice evolution but may propagate transversely across slices under appropriate curvature or energy conditions.

\nabla_t S(x^i, n) = \frac{\partial S^{(n)}(x^i)}{\partial n}

Entropy becomes a tensorial entity tied to the slice’s embedding and orientation, potentially deforming spacetime geometry itself.

3.4 Curvature, Entropy, and Inter-Slice Dynamics

In our extended model, the curvature of one slice may influence the embedding and entropy state of adjacent slices, especially near gravitational wells or rapid entropic transitions. These inter-slice gravitational interactions establish the groundwork for defining temporal shear—a form of entropic tension across hypersurfaces with observable consequences.

4. Inter-Slice Gravitational Coupling and Temporal Shear

4.1 Rethinking Gravitational Influence in a Layered Universe

We extend Einstein’s field equations by proposing nonlocal gravitational influence across temporally adjacent slices of the block universe. Extrinsic curvature of one hypersurface can exert strain on its neighbors, creating trans-temporal coupling.

4.2 Temporal Shear: Definition and Mechanism

Temporal shear is defined as the geometric and entropic strain induced by curvature and entropy mismatches between slices. When entropic differentials are sharp, the mismatch induces a dissipative response manifesting as heat or curvature deformation.

4.3 Shear Heat

We define shear heat via:

\Delta Q_{\text{shear}} \propto \left| \nabla S_{n} - \nabla S_{n+1} \right|

It emerges in regions of significant entropy gradient misalignment and may manifest as void heating or anisotropic lensing.

4.4 Entropy-Curvature Gradient as Coupling Agent

We quantify this interaction through:

\Delta S = \nabla_t S_n = \frac{dS}{dn} \quad ; \quad \Delta K = \nabla_t K_n = \frac{dK}{dn}

The gradients define shear-active zones, driving local energetic and structural anomalies.

5. Fractal Structure of Time and Quantum Emergence

5.1 Fractal Geometry as a Cosmological Framework

Inspired by scale relativity, we propose each slice contains fractal substructure. This recursive geometry allows for non-integer scaling of entropy, potentially explaining deviations in thermodynamic or quantum behavior.

5.2 Quantum Indeterminacy as Fractal Resonance

Feynman’s path integral maps naturally onto fractal probability trees. We interpret quantum uncertainty as recursive entropy misalignment across slices, producing phase decoherence and stochastic resonance.

5.3 Entropic Bifurcation and Decoherence

Wavefunction collapse is reconceptualized as a convergence failure of entropy trajectories within a fractal-temporal lattice.

5.4 Nested Time and Observer Emergence

Observers are not inert. They are entropic attractors whose thermodynamic paths stabilize regions of coherence within a fractally embedded manifold.

6. Mathematical Framework

We formalize the interactions described above by modeling entropy, curvature, and shear in a temporally foliated 4D spacetime.

6.1 Entropy and Curvature Gradients Across Slices

Define slice-indexed scalar and tensor fields:

\nabla_t S(x^i, n) = \frac{\partial S^{(n)}(x^i)}{\partial n}
\quad ; \quad
\nabla_t K_{ij}(x^i, n) = \frac{\partial K_{ij}^{(n)}(x^i)}{\partial n}

These describe inter-slice entropy and curvature variation.

6.2 Temporal Shear Tensor

We define:

\Xi_{ij} = \nabla_t K_{ij} + \alpha \left( \nabla_i \nabla_t S \right)

Where \alpha is a coupling constant linking entropy flow and curvature deformation.

6.3 Shear Heat

We quantify dissipative energy via:

\Delta Q_{\text{shear}} \propto \int_{\Sigma} \left| \Xi_{ij} \Xi^{ij} \right| \, d^3x

This describes energy flux from temporal misalignment.

6.4 Entropy-Curvature Field Equation

We propose:

\nabla_t K_{ij} - \beta \, h_{ij} \nabla_t S + \gamma R_{ij} = 0

Where \beta, \gamma are constants, R_{ij} is the Ricci tensor, and h_{ij} is the induced metric.

6.5 Covariant Generalization and Energy Flux

Using Lie derivatives:

\mathcal{L}n K{\mu\nu} + \beta \, h_{\mu\nu} \nabla_t S + \gamma \, R_{\mu\nu} = 0

Q^\mu = \lambda \, h^{\mu\nu} \Xi^{\alpha}{\ \nu} \nabla\alpha S
\quad ; \quad \nabla_\mu Q^\mu = \text{local dissipation rate}

6.6 Fractal Deformation Across Slices

Recursive shear at sub-slice resolution:

\Xi_{ij}^{(n,k)} = \nabla_t K_{ij}^{(n,k)} + \alpha_k \left( \nabla_i \nabla_t S^{(n,k)} \right)

This introduces multi-scale entropy deformation aligned with quantum effects.
