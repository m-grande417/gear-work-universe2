The Horizon Spine Hypothesis

Light and Black Holes as Dual Embeddings of a Singular 4D Structure

By M. Grande

Abstract

This paper proposes that what we observe as light and black holes—massless radiation and infinitely dense curvature—are not distinct physical entities, but dimensional cross-sections of the same continuous four-dimensional thermodynamic structure. Termed the Horizon Spine, this entity stretches across entropy and curvature gradients in a stratified block universe. When this 4D spine intersects our 3D “now slice,” it appears to us either as photons (light) or black holes, depending on the observer’s location within the entropy-curvature spectrum. What we perceive as multiple instances of light or black holes are, in this view, merely fragmented observations of a singular, continuous process viewed from within lower-dimensional time-embedded slices.

1. Introduction

In traditional physics, photons and black holes sit at opposite extremes: one travels freely through space with no rest mass, the other bends space so strongly that not even light can escape. However, in a 4D block universe governed by entropy-curvature dynamics and inter-slice coupling (as outlined in the parent theory), such extreme polarity may be a mirage caused by our limited dimensional perspective.

This hypothesis reframes both light and black holes as temporally-situated, entropy-defined projections of a unified structure—not multiple entities, but a single cosmic strand perceived differently at different moments and locations in the manifold.

2. The Horizon Spine: A Unifying Entity

We define the Horizon Spine as a four-dimensional object whose full form exists in the layered spacetime structure of the block universe. Its two primary poles, when intersected by our 3D observational plane, appear as:
	•	Photons: the forward-dissipative boundary of the spine, characterized by zero rest mass, maximal velocity, and directional entropy emission.
	•	Black Holes: the entropic convergence zone of the spine, where curvature becomes maximal, entropy saturates, and time appears to halt locally.

From a 4D perspective, these are not different things—they are different angles of the same spine, interacting with the observer’s slice via entropy gradient and curvature alignment.

3. Observational Fragmentation of Unity

Because we exist within one temporal slice at a time, our minds evolved to parse structure in localized, snapshot form. This restricts our understanding of any full 4D entity. Just as a 2D observer encountering a 3D object might perceive only disconnected circles or lines, we perceive a continuous 4D spine as separate events: flashes of light, points of darkness, particles, and singularities.

This leads to an important implication: all light we see may be the same light, and all black holes we detect may be the same curvature fold, viewed at different spatial-temporal angles.

4. Curvature and Entropy as Coordinates

Rather than treating time and space as the primary axes of this structure, the Horizon Spine is best described through curvature (K) and entropy density (S) as orientational dimensions. This reframes the photon as a point of minimal curvature and entropy, and the black hole as a terminal fold of maximal curvature and entropy.

The progression from light to black hole may thus reflect an unfolding entropy-curvature flow rather than distinct objects evolving independently. Their apparent multiplicity emerges from the fractal slicing of this spine by the observer’s dimensional cross-section.

5. Consequences and Predictions

5.1 All Photons as One

All observed light may originate from the same 4D object intersecting multiple points of our spacetime. This reimagines the cosmological lightcone as a spiral filament, with each intersection a different “event” of the same photon spine.

5.2 All Black Holes as One

Similarly, every black hole might be a temporal phase of the same curvature structure—possibly the “fold-back” end of the Horizon Spine, forming a closed thermodynamic arc.

5.3 Unification of Quantum and Relativistic Poles

Photons (quantum, massless, delocalized) and black holes (relativistic, massive, localized) may be unified not through a Grand Unified Theory, but by recognizing them as inverse curvatures of the same 4D entity, revealing symmetry between gravity and electromagnetism through their origin in geometric slicing.

6. Diagram (Conceptual Description)

Imagine a 4D ribbon stretching across a block universe. One end is flat, smooth, and emits radiation—this is the photon pole. The ribbon twists and folds across temporal entropy gradients. At the far end, the ribbon tightens into a spiral well—this is the black hole pole. We, embedded in a 3D now-slice, only ever see tiny intersections of this ribbon—points of light or darkness—never the whole structure.

⸻

7. Conclusion

This hypothesis proposes that photons and black holes, while distinct in observable properties, may represent a singular ontological object: the Horizon Spine. We fragment it by our observation method, carving dimensional slices through a unified structure.

This not only offers a conceptual bridge between quantum mechanics and general relativity, but also strengthens the central claim of the entropy-shear block universe: that time is not a line but a lattice, and that existence is not plural but parallax.
