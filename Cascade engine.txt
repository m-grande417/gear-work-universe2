Recursive Entropic Reversals in a Layered Block Universe

Abstract

We propose a novel cosmological mechanism in which local entropy reversals drive a recursive, self-perpetuating wave of collapse and expansion throughout a four-dimensional block universe. In this framework, each region of spacetime is treated as a layered thermodynamic system embedded within a stratified manifold. When a contracting locality reaches maximum curvature and entropic tension, it undergoes a reversal in entropic orientation, initiating a localized expansion phase. This event—perceived internally as a “Big Bang”—exerts trans-temporal shear on adjacent regions, triggering their own collapse and eventual reversal. The result is a thermodynamic cascade: a recursive sequence of entropic phase transitions propagating across the universe like a four-dimensional wave. This model offers a dynamic alternative to singular-origin cosmologies and unifies entropy, curvature, and time within a continuous feedback structure.

1. Introduction: From Big Bang to Big Cascade

The standard cosmological narrative begins with a singular event: the Big Bang. Yet such a view raises persistent questions about origin, causality, and the thermodynamic arrow of time. What if the Big Bang was not a beginning, but a local reversal of entropy within a larger 4D structure? What if such reversals were not unique, but ubiquitous—triggered recursively across a stratified manifold?

This paper introduces the concept of the Cascade Engine: a recursive chain of entropy-driven collapses and reversals that unfold not linearly through time, but geometrically through adjacent slices of a layered block universe. This mechanism preserves the second law of thermodynamics, eliminates the need for a singular origin, and replaces metaphysical inflation with a natural, testable wave structure embedded in curved spacetime.

2. Layered Time and Local Thermodynamics

We begin with the block universe model, wherein spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold \mathcal{M} foliated into 3D spacelike hypersurfaces \Sigma_n, each representing a “now” slice. Each slice is endowed with:
	•	A metric h_{ij}
	•	An extrinsic curvature tensor K_{ij}
	•	A localized entropy field S^{(n)}(x^i)

In this framework, each region of \mathcal{M} functions as a semi-autonomous thermodynamic system. Interactions occur not just across space, but between adjacent slices—creating trans-temporal feedback loops governed by curvature and entropy gradients.

3. The Collapse-Reversal Sequence

When a region becomes sufficiently dense, its curvature increases, compressing adjacent slices. As entropy rises and free energy decreases, the system approaches a maximum entropic gradient—a point at which traditional thermodynamic flow becomes unstable. At this threshold:
	1.	The locality collapses into a curvature-dense structure—analogous to a singularity.
	2.	Entropic flow reverses direction: instead of progressing into further contraction, the gradient inverts.
	3.	This initiates a localized expansion, perceived from within as a Big Bang.

Critically, this is not a reversal of the past, but the beginning of a new entropic trajectory through future slices. The local arrow of time flips, but the global structure remains coherent.

4. Trans-Temporal Strain and Neighboring Collapse

The reversal event is not isolated. The sudden expansion of a locality exerts gravitational and thermodynamic shear on neighboring regions, distorting their curvature profiles and entropy orientations. This stress induces:
	•	Local compression of adjacent slices
	•	Increased curvature in neighboring zones
	•	Initiation of secondary collapse

These neighbors then follow the same sequence: contraction → singularity → reversal → expansion.

5. Recursive Propagation: The Cascade Engine

This process forms a recursive cascade:
	•	Region A collapses and reverses
	•	A’s expansion pulls on Region B
	•	Region B contracts and reaches singularity
	•	B reverses and expands, pulling on Region C…

This wave-like propagation continues indefinitely across the block universe. It does not require global simultaneity or synchronization—each reversal is local, but linked through the shared geometry of entropy and curvature.

The Cascade Engine is not cyclic in time, but recursive in structure—an endless sequence of localized genesis events, each embedded within and triggered by others.

6. Thermodynamic Legitimacy

This model preserves the second law of thermodynamics within each locality. The apparent reversal is a result of frame-relative entropy orientation, not a violation of entropy increase. From a higher-dimensional perspective:
	•	Entropy always increases along the flow of the manifold
	•	Reversal marks a coordinate flip, not a negation of thermodynamic law
	•	Each expansion begins with low relative entropy due to the reinitialization of degrees of freedom

Thus, no thermodynamic reset is required. The Cascade Engine functions as an eternal entropy-differential machine.

7. Observational Implications

If our own Big Bang is the result of such a reversal, then:
	•	The observable universe is a localized thermodynamic cone, not the whole of reality
	•	Other regions of \mathcal{M} may currently be in contraction or pre-reversal states
	•	Redshift patterns may reflect not expansion from a single origin, but proximity to curvature gradients and reversal boundaries
	•	CMB anomalies, void heating, or lensing drift may signal adjacent reversals or contraction fronts

⸻

8. Philosophical and Structural Implications
	•	No beginning is needed: genesis is a continuous structural feature, not a singular moment.
	•	Time becomes braided: not one arrow, but a lattice of entropic orientations.
	•	Observers arise from entropy: each reversal produces the thermodynamic conditions for observation, meaning each expansion may give rise to awareness and structure.
	•	The universe becomes eternal not by repetition, but by recursion.

9. Conclusion: The Universe That Folds and Breathes

The Cascade Engine reframes the universe not as a singular expansion or oscillating cosmos, but as a recursive, breathing entity—a four-dimensional body in which regions collapse, reverse, and unfurl into new domains of space and structure. Entropy does not end this universe; it drives its endless becoming.

Each Big Bang is a breath. Each collapse, an exhale. The manifold expands not in all directions at once, but in ripples—thermodynamic echoes through the curvature of layered time.

In this view, the universe does not begin or end.
It folds.
It turns.
It becomes.
