Here’s a summary table of key cosmological anomalies and how the Gear-Phase Cosmology attempts to explain them:

Anomaly	Problem in Standard Model (ΛCDM)	Gear-Phase Explanation
CMB Cold Spot / Asymmetries	Unexpected large-scale temperature fluctuations and directional bias	Result of nearby gear-phase reversals causing thermodynamic and curvature distortions in the CMB 
Void Heating	Some large cosmic voids are hotter than predicted	Caused by shear heating at boundaries between collapsing and expanding gears 
Gravitational Lensing Drift	Lensing patterns show drift or asymmetry beyond baryonic mass effects	Caused by curvature shear from adjacent gears altering light paths 
Redshift Anomalies / Hubble Tension	Discrepancy in measured expansion rates from different methods	Light travels through gears with varying entropy gradients, causing non-uniform redshifts 
Initial Low Entropy	Universe’s beginning had extremely low entropy without clear reason	Each Big Bang is a local reversal, naturally starting with low relative entropy 
Arrow of Time	No explanation for why time flows one way	Time direction is local, set by entropy flow in each gear; globally, time is symmetric 
Structure Without Inflation	Inflation required to explain cosmic uniformity and structure	Reversals create local uniformity, and gear interactions seed structure formation without inflation

This table highlights how the model offers coherent alternatives to explain puzzling features of our universe—though these explanations remain theoretical until observationally confirmed.
